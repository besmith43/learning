# M4

M4 is a macro preprocessor from the 1970's.
In this example, we're testing it out with golang.
We're using [Curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) as an example for the use of M4 within a project.

### Goals

I'd like to bring the following to this program:

- #if DEBUG preprocessor
- cmptime (see zig's macro system)



### Requirements

- golang compiler
- m4 processor
	- for unix: it's probably already there
	- for windows: [gnuwin32](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/m4.htm)
