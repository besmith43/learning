# lessons learned

a standard hello world go program is 1.9MB once compiled

the streamlyne compiled binary is 2MB

and before moving the embedded folder into the main folder for the program, it was 2.1MB

I think it's save to say that the go compiler only compiles the go files specifically linked

with the pdf the final binary size for suitable is 7.8MB and streamlyne is still at 2MB
