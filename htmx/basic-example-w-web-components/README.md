# HTMX and Web Components Example

The point of this project is to test the validity of htmx with native web components being served from a generic C# backend api.  Not sure if there's a need for an app specific api for the frontend to talk to (think go html templates in between the frontend, that's running in the client's browser, and the C# backend).
