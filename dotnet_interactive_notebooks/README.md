# Dotnet Interactive Notebooks


### Note to Self

I think with the change from dotnet interactive notebooks to polyglot notebooks, it's best no to use the .dib file extension.
The vscode plugin doesn't seem to know what to do with it.
Now, the .ipynb file extension on the other hand.
That this is on fire!!!
