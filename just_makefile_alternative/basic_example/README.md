# How to use this?

First install just.
This can be done with cargo (a rust toolchain thing), or by using your normal package manager as detailed on the [github page](https://github.com/casey/just).
Next, you can list the options with the -l flag like this:

```bash
	just -l
```

Finally you can run the options just like you would with make.
In this example, we'll call the run action.

```bash
	just run
```
