### Summary

Man Pages are the original terminal help documentation.
These documents are generated by tools like groff, and presented through cli apps like less and more.

### Per User Defined Man Paths

To setup a custom manpath on a per user basis, create a ```~/.manpath``` file and place the desired path preceeded by MANDATORY_PATH.
A little something like this:

```
MANDATORY_PATH /Users/besmith/.local/share/man
```

Now at the end of this path, you'll need a man1 directory and every man page within that directory needs to have a .1 extension.
Then for every additional man page type (1-8), you'll need to follow the same pattern.

### Global Modifications

To add a new man path for the entire system, you'll need to edit either the ```/etc/man.conf``` or ```/etc/manpaths``` files.
These files have the default paths for your operating system.
